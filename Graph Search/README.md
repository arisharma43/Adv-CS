In this lab you need to implement an original Breadth First Search algorithm to detect whether a path exists from a start point to an end point.

In this lab you will utilize the C++ standard library linked list class and a C++ 'iterator'.  And you can see how to iterate through the adjacency matrix in the graph::display() method.

Input data is provide in a format similar to that used in UIL competition.

Number of vertices (vertices are 0 to Number - 1)

vertices X count of edges where X is the vertice number

list of edges (separated by space)

Example for three(3) vertices

3

2

1 2

1

2

1

1

0 2

Sets

vertice 0 -> 1 and 2

vertice 1 -> 2

vertice 2 -> 1

does path exist from 0 to 2
